NOTES!!!!! ABOUT VIRTUAL PET PROJECT

By passing in all statuses from constructor is the plan to give user access to change them
Good Job with findVirtualPet
Pet Shelter Line 7  may want to include list or HashMap in the HashMaps variable name, may be confusing 
Add Documentation
Application class is very good
Maybe add a way that user can check the status of their pet throughout the game
Application Class:
 to make readablity easier instead of toLowerCase().equals()  you can just call .equalsIgnoreCase()

 NOTES FROM LOOKING AT OTHER GROUP'S APP
 you can give values in the properties (they gave boredom and whatnot initial values in the pet class)
 can use boolean for whether pet is organic or not
 "raw" used for "rawName",etc, to show user input
 instead of using happiness, they have the pet faint "if" values drop below a certain number
 their getStatusChange adds properties to previous property value
 they had tests for each property (boredom, etc) after ticks and after playing and whatnot
